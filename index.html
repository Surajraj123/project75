          especially for lower primary class students! Kids love visiting the school library as it gives them a chance to explore so 
          many colourful sections of books that will open the world to them. 
          The books they read and the illustrations they notice in the books develop their creativity and imagination skills. 
          Writing an essay about a school library is an excellent way to teach the kids about the power of knowledge they gain from books.

      <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, 
        Actually It was like a surprise for me, 
        I was completely shocked when I got to know that I have won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution.
         It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. 
         At the time when I participated for the very first time so I did not secure any position in this competition, 
         At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I did do more hard work and I will participate again and 
         I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, 
         Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, 
         I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do 
         more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, 
         My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and 
         now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

      <p>Two months ago, I had the privilege of taking part in an inter-school extempore competition. First, 
        a screening contest was held in our school. Around twenty students delivered a speech on the topic. 
        â€œIs the education of women necessary for the upliftment of Indian society? We all had prepared well, 
        but the final result had the names of the best three participants only. My joy knew no bounds, when I saw my name in the list. 
        I had no idea that I would be selected. 
        I had done well, no doubt, but to represent my school in an inter-school competition was a very big responsibility.

The competition was a month away. A month? It was too short a time to prepare on all the topic under the sun,
 I selected a number of recent topics and started preparing myself earnestly. I wanted to win laurels for my school. 
 It did not mater to me if I did not win, but at the same time, I wanted to earn a good reputation for my school. 
 My father helped me a lot, he would point out weaknesses, and within a month, I was ready to face the contest.

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The canteen in my school provides students,
         teachers and other staff with delicious food and drink in hygienic condition.
          I know that instead of buying things from roadside sellers, 
          it is safe to eat canteen food. Roadside food can spoil our health.
           I am lucky to have such a good canteen in my school.

        Teachers and other staff members are served by canteen boys in trays. 
        They are served with some light refreshments, tea, coffee, soft drinks, etc. 
        They eat it in their office and staffroom during lunch and short breaks. Even they enjoy canteen food wholehearted.
        
        Many find our school canteen as a great advantage to both pupils and staff. 
        However, a few PTA members do not think so. 
        They think that school encourages students to spend money on eating outside food.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The onset of the coronavirus
       pandemic several months ago has changed our lifestyles in a great way. 
      People of all ages have to stay indoors in order to avoid falling sick.
       All those who used to go to offices are working from their respective homes and fulfilling their job responsibilities. 
       In the same manner, schools have also started working from home. 
       With the help of an online school management system, 
       educational institutions are taking care of all the aspects of their school management. 
       From online admissions to virtual classes and conducting tests, everything is made possible with the most viable school ERP 
       software.
      Several changes have been implemented by the educational system so as to keep up the continual learning process and this includes 
      a reduction in the syllabus, an examination system that is easily manageable and a change in the number of hours that students are 
      required to undertake the online classes. How are the myriad aspects of school management being handled by educational institutions? 
      Letâ€™s take a look at the same in the following lines.</p>
